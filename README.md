### Usage

1. Go to the A Dance With Dragon game page.
2. Run `replayer.exe` run as administrator.
3. Move the mouse over `Play` on game page, then press `b` to start. (If you haven't beaten the game, progress through the tutorial until one step left to enter the game. Then position the mouse cursor over the button and press `b`).
4. Watch it play. (The script only runs up to the boss. You need to handle the boss fight yourself).
5. Use `esc` to exit the program.


### Q&A
1. What should I do if my combo breaks, I miss an enemy, or I die?

* The script's performance can be affected by cpu and memory usage of your pc. You can try closing other programs besides Dota 2, lowering Dota 2's graphics settings, or attempting the script another time. You can also interrupt the script midway by using the `esc` key and take control yourself.

3. Why doesn't the script include the boss fight?

* The boss's bullet patterns are random, making it difficult to defeat with fixed actions.

2. Will it get you VAC banned?

* No, the script only performs actions in a fixed sequence and does not access game data.
